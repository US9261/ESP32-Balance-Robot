This repository contains all resource files needed to replicate the high speed, two wheeled balancing robot. 

For some videos, see my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7hvI_Tb0o4).

Please be aware that this code is very experimental / far from complete. So, you'll probably have to implement some stuff yourself. Also, use at your own risk.
